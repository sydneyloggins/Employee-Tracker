# Employee Tracker

## Description


This command line application utilizes JavaScript, mySQL, and Node to display a company's employee database. The application allows the user to input data entries based on new roles, departments, and employee names. The motivation behind this project is to learn how to implement tools we have learned with mySQL and how to connect the database to a command line app.
